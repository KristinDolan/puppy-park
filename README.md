Puppy Park is a point-and-click game made with GameMakerStudio2 using GML, a custom code language in the engine that shares many aspects with Javascript. Puppy Park is inspired by the mobile phone game Neko Atsume, made by Hit Point Co., Ltd.
As the code only exists within the .yyp game file, it will not be available to view here, but this repository exists as a place to show when I make updates to this game, and to act as a backup.
